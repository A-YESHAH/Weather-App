# Weather-App
A simple and interactive weather application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data for any city in the world. The app displays temperature, city name, humidity, wind speed, and shows an icon based on current weather conditions like ☀️ Clear, ☁️ Clouds, 🌧️ Rain, or ❄️ Snow.
